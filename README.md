# Pangram_Python
Code to check if given string is pangram or not in Python3 (v3.11.9)

"for i in alph" will iterate through each alphabet, if even 1 alphabet is not present in the string, if block will be executed and it will return false and exit the function body. If all alphabets are present, true will be returned
.lower() eliminates the need to consider capital alphabets
